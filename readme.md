# PHPisms

This repo is a collection of notes and examples I've put together while studying for the Zend PHP 5 Certification exam. I highly recommend the [Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide, 3rd Edition](https://www.phparch.com/books/zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-3rd-edition/) even if you do not plan on taking the exam. Most of the information here is from that book, the PHP docs and a few blogs. I've tried to cite where appropriate. Lots of great information.
