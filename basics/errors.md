## Introduction

PHP reports errors in response to a number of conditions. These errors may be displayed and/or logged as desired.

Every error generated by PHP includes a [type](#types). You can control what types of errors PHP reports by setting the `error_reporting` php.ini directive or via the `error_reporting()` function at runtime.

## Types

PHP defines the following predefined constants as part of the PHP core. The PHP Manual has the [description and numeric value for each constant](http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php). Note that the constants' numeric values are used to build up a bitmask that specifies which errors to report.
